# File-Organiser-Project-using-Node.js
This is my first project using Node.js .This File Organiser program will help you view and manage your file more efficiently 

This Project can do following functions :

      1. Organise : This command will organise all your files and folders in a given directory by making a new folder named as "Organised-folder"
                    and moving all the files aaccording to their type or format.      
      2. Tree : This command will display all the content in a given directory by displaying the files , folders and the files inside the folders.
     
To use this File-Organiser tool follow the following steps:

      1. Install Node.js and npm in your system globally.
      2. Import all the files and folders I have created in this repo
      3. Open the folder in VS CODE
      4. Open the terminal in the same directory as of project and run following commands:
            a. npm init -y :- this will initalise the npm and make a package.json file
            b. Check the package.json file similar to my package.json file or do the changes accordingly
            c. Run npm link
            d. Your system is ready to run the command globally
      5. Open terminal anywhere in your system and run the command `file-organser <command> "directory-path in quotes" `
